# Ð¡offee price prediction

What is a Problem? Lack of data for economic prediction tasks.

Methodology :
Use time-series number ranges

In this task, I have a hidden Markov model of prediction, because I do not have data about an exact amount of coffee bean production, so I will make a  hypothesis that the weather can describe a coffee bean production.
